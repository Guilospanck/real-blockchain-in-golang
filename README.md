## c1_genesis_json
The blockchain is a database. The token supply, initial user balances and global blockchain settings are defined in a Genesis file.

## c2_db_changes.txt
The Genesis balances indicate what was the original blockchain state and are never updated afterwards.
The database state changes are called *Transactions (TX)*.

## c3_state_blockchain_component
